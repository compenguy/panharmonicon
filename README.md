Command-line Pandora client.

# Background

A panharmonicon is an [instrument invented in 1805](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panharmonicon)
by a friend of Beethoven.  It was similar to a player piano in that it could automatically play
specially programmed music, but had the capacity to imitate all instruments and sound effects,
including gunfire and cannon shots.

# Screenshots

Scalable interface that provides full featureset in as little as 6 lines, and
intelligently scales interface elements down to 3 lines (although one line
works, too!).

On terminals that support it, allows mouse interactions with the interface.
Station select, volume control, pause, resume, skip to next song, rate tracks,
and remove track ratings all using your keyboard or mouse.
